Pong Game Readme
Introduction:
This repository contains a Python implementation of the classic arcade game Pong. The game is built using the Turtle module for graphics and provides a simple interface for two players to control paddles and bounce a ball back and forth.

Usage:
To play the Pong game, execute the pong.py file using Python. Once the game window opens, follow the on-screen instructions to control the paddles:

Player 1 (right paddle) uses the Up and Down arrow keys to move up and down.
Player 2 (left paddle) uses the W and S keys to move up and down.
The game continues until one player scores 5 points. The player with the highest score wins the game.

Files:
pong.py: Main Python script containing the game logic and setup.
paddle.py: Python script defining the Paddle class for player control.
ball.py: Python script defining the Ball class for ball movement and collision detection.
scoreboard.py: Python script defining the Scoreboard class to keep track of player scores.
